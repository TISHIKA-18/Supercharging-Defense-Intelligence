# Supercharging-Defense-Intelligence
Imagine you’re a defense analyst with minutes to deliver critical insights on Operation Sindoor or India’s Gaganyaan mission from a 29-page report. Every second counts. That’s where AI shines—or does it? I built a cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LlamaIndex and OpenAI to tackle this challenge, analyzing the NPC07May2025.pdf defense report. By pitting three AI models—GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4-turbo—against each other, I uncovered game-changing differences in how fast they process queries. The results? One model is a speed demon, and it could redefine real-time intelligence. Let’s dive into what I found and why it matters.
